# odin-mastermind
## The Odin Project - Mastermind

Object oriented programming Ruby project - build a Mastermind game from the command line

## Languages/Technologies used:
 - Ruby
 - VS Code
 - Git/Github

## What I learned:
 - Worked on splitting things into separate classes for each part of the game, still can improve on this
 
## Still can improve:
 - Need to consider if anything should be private
 - Keeping methods simple and concise
 - Add game board display, colors
 - I think the Game class is probably doing too much
 - Computer algorithm runs a little slow
